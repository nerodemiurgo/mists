## [1.0.4] - 2020-08-19
### Changed
- Changed the depends_on() method back to what it was in version 1.0.0, where it was requiring phpBB v3.2.1, and added a new migration file with the sole purpose of having the depends_on() method require phpBB v3.2.2.

- When disabling the extension, all existing primenotify notifications are changed into their board default equivalents and then all primenotify notification types are removed from the database rather than trying to directly convert primenotify notification types back into board default types which could cause an SQL error if the board default types already existed for any user.
